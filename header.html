    <P><b>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</b> was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal,
        the
        capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo
        António.[8][9] He is
        the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis
        Aveiro,
        a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[10] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel
        da
        Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[11] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two
        older
        sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[12] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to
        poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to
        perform
        the procedure.[13][14] Ronaldo</P>

    <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who
        was
        impressed with his dribbling.[25] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's
        under-16,
        under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year
        later, on
        29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he
        scored
        two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[26] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his
        representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president
        Joan
        Laporta.[27] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's
        stadium
        in November to discuss a possible transfer.[28]

        Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move
        urgently,
        after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003.
        Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[29] Having
        been
        impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to
        pay
        Sporting £12.24 million[29] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he
        had
        ever seen.[30] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo
        by
        selecting him to become their 100,000th member.</p>

    <h2 id="internationalcareer"><u>international career:</u></h2>
    <p>Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth
        career,
        Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides,
        amassing 34
        youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[6]

        Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20
        August
        2003,[337] coming on as a half-time substitute for Luís Figo.[338] He was subsequently called up for
        UEFA
        Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage
        loss to
        eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[338] After converting his penalty in
        a
        shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[339] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring
        the
        opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.[340] He was featured in the team of the tournament,
        having
        provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[341]

        Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World
        Cup with
        seven goals.[337] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a
        penalty kick
        in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[342] At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo
        became the
        youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[343] In Portugal's infamously dirty
        round of 16
        match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from
        Dutch
        defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[338] Following Portugal's 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of
        intentionally
        trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[344] In Portugal's
        quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for
        stamping
        on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was
        only due
        to Rooney's infraction,[345] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision
        by
        aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following
        Rooney's
        dismissal.[338][346] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which
        sent
        Portugal into the semi-finals.[338] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final
        defeat to
        France.[347] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player
        award and
        handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[338][348]
        Following
        the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro
        2008,
        scoring two goals in the process.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a> </p>
    <h2 id="Personallife"><u>Personal Life:</u></h2>
    <p>In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011
        and 2014,
        a claim he denied at the time.[595] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail
        sentence and
        fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities.
        The
        sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not
        re-offend.[596]

        Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape
        allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation
        and
        Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a
        prosecution.[597]

        In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police
        Department for an
        allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[598][599] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's
        lawyers,
        state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[598][600] Ronaldo and his
        lawyers
        issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an "intentional defamation
        campaign"
        with parts significantly "altered and/or completely fabricated",[601][602] a claim which Der Spiegel
        categorically denied.[603] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo
        over
        allegations of rape; the statement added: "Based upon a review of information at this time, the
        allegations
        of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."[604] The
        same
        woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[605] The Daily
        Mirror,
        citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from
        Ronaldo.[606] In
        October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed,
        citing
        that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, "acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using
        Football
        Leaks documents to prosecute" the case, despite the documents containing "privileged communications"
        between
        Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's
        lawyers
        having "intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement" during the 2010 settlement with
        her.[607] In
        June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court
        for the
        District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of
        "cyber-hacked
        attorney-client privileged documents" were actions representing "abuses and flagrant circumvention
        of the
        proper litigation process"</p>

        Juventus beat Liverpool FC to win the 1985 European Cup at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, but the victory was
        overshadowed by tragedy when surging Liverpool supporters—who were charging Juventus fans—collapsed a wall,
        killing 39 fans. Eleven years later Juve returned to the Champions League (as the European Cup is now known)
        final, beating Ajax of the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out to win its second continental championship.
        Juventus has also won three Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cups (1977, 1990, 1993), two UEFA
        Super Cups (1984, 1996), and a European Cup Winners’ Cup (1984). Domestically, the club has won a bevy of
        Italian Cups and Italian Super Cups.

        Juventus has triumphed in the Italian league, known since 1929 as Serie A, a record 35 times. In 2006 that total
        was reduced, as the club’s Serie A titles from 2004–05 and 2005–06 were removed as a result of club officials’
        roles in a match-fixing scandal that involved a number of Italian clubs. Juventus was relegated to Serie B (the
        first relegation in club history) for the 2006–07 season as an additional punishment, but it earned promotion
        back to Serie A the following season.</p>
